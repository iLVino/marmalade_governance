Marmalade project description.

The digital DAO based economy model for small businesses.  

In this project a marmalade manufacturing is considered ðŸ«™.

On the Stage_1 is a Marmalade NFTs as a product. 
Stage 2 assumes star of a real Marmalade production with customer delivery (including an NFT to the each product).

Virtual business model:
The business model consists of 4 main elements:
1-> Factory with workers;
2-> Market place;
3-> Customers;
4-> Holding DAO.


Business Mechanics:
Factory is producing on the Stage_1 Mamalade NFTs and delivering thet to the Market place. From the Market place customers are buying NFTs as a product.
The Marmalade NFTs can be strored in the collection, traded or burned for mGovernance tokens.

There will be two governance directions established:
1-> mGovernace - marketing governence. Where customers will have proposal and voting rigths according they mGovernance tokens share;
2-> pGovernance - production governance. Here all production related topics for the factory will be managed. 
The pGovernance tokens will be distributed accros workers.

For the participation in governance the Value Tokens will be distributed for the vouters. The tokenomics is tbd.

The core project product in the Stage_1 are NFTs.

The hiring in the Factory will be done by NFT as a Contract (with the Graph integration). 
Working and contribution by the production will be rewarded with Value tokens. 
The Value tokens are backed by the treasury and funded through NFT sales (and possibly adds on the web page) income. 


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
